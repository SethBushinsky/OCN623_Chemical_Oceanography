- The ocean carbon cycle exists within the larger global carbon cycle
 - It is important to have a grasp of the relative magnitude of different fluxes / reservoirs of carbon in the earth system

### Natural vs. Anthropogenic vs. Contemporary
- Definitions
 - Contemporary = Natural + Anthropogenic
 - Natural: pre-industrial carbon fluxes
 - Anthropogenic: This can be tricky. "Anthropogenic" carbon is not whether or not an individual "C" atom came from fossil fuels, it is the change in the C storage or C flux between pre-anthropogenic times and present day.
  - Note about direct or indirect changes, include link to Hauck paper

### Current anthropogenic fluxes:
- Emissions: 11 Pg C yr-1
- Atmospheric: 5 Pg C yr-1
- Ocean uptake: 2.5 Pg C yr-1
 - Approximately: -0.6 Natural outgassing + 2.5 anthropogenic uptake = 1.9 Contemporary Ocean uptake

### Current contemporary fluxes:
- Units: Pg C yr-1
- Solubility pump: 264 down, 275 up
- Bio pump (ANCP): ~13 
 - Biological carbon export is ~5-10% the magnitude of the solubility pump
 - Significant uncertainty in control / response to changes
 - Provides an avenue for long-term burial

- Sediment: 0.2

Question, Does biological carbon pump contribute to ocean’s uptake of anthropogenic carbon?

### **Sidebar - Global Carbon Budget Units**:
* You will often see units of either PgC or Gigatonne C.
* You will also see either C or CO2.
