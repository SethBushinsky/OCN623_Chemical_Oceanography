Learning objectives:
- Describe the properties of saltwater that are important to how the ocean circulates
- Understand differences between units and why it matters
- Broadly distinguish physical / circulation differences between different ocean basins
- Identify different elemental behavior and explain the rationale for classification

### Hydrogen bonding

### Salinity
#### Measurement
#### Impact on Circulation

### Stratification and Mixing
- Mixing happens along isopycnals, not isobars - multiple orders of magnitude faster mixing along isopycnals than across (diapycnal mixing)

### Circulation and Biology
- As waters age (circulate through the ocean, out of contact with the atmosphere) they accumulate the signal of respiration
- [ photosynthesis / respiration equation]

### Section view $$\neq$$ Actual Circulation
- [gif of SAMW pathway from observations]


### Units
- Volume vs. mass in the denominator?

#### The impact of pressure on temperature and density (in-situ vs. potential)
[-In-situ vs. potential temperature figures]



### Element Classification


### Composition of the Atmosphere

### Gas Solubility
